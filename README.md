`DisasterPlanning.cpp` takes in a road network and a number of cities that are able
 to be supplied. It then returns whether all cities will be covered for
 disasters, and, if so, a possibility as to how to allocate supplies.
 
 `Matchmaker.cpp` has two parts. The first part, hasPerfectMatching,
 takes in a map of people and potential matches. It returns if
 it is possible, with this set of people, for every to be
 matched with a potential partner.
 
 WeightedMatches instead takes in a map of people as well
 as their weighted preferences for partners. It then
 returns a set of partners for which the "happiness
 weight" is maximized."
